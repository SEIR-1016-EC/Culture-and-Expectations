### **Common Student Concerns.**

1. I'm making a lot of mistakes.
    1. Mistakes are learning opportunities! There is a solution for each learning opportunity, which will help you debug the same problem in the future!
2. What about imposter syndrome?
    1. Imposter syndrome is something most of us deal with, and it is okay to feel this way! A quick search online or on YouTube and you’ll find resources to hush that negative chatter in your mind. [Here’s one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQUxL4Jm1Lo) to start! I also encourage you to reach out to a member on the instructional team, we can always chat about it!
3. I don't "do" math.
    1. Math found in code challenges and throughout learning content is kept lightweight! It is good to have exposure to some mathematical expressions!
4. What's the best practice? How do I find the one "correct" answer?
    1. First, we solve it, then we optimize it. Solving is 90% of the problem.
5. What if I don't have a perfect understanding of everything?
    - This course is set up to accommodate students of all ability levels.
        - We use scaffolded learning, lecture notes, homework, and projects.
    - We make sure you at least understand the most essential concepts.
6. What if I'm having trouble building an amazing portfolio/completing all of the assignments?
    - All projects are challenging.
        - What matters is the ability to think through the problems they present.
        - The instructional team is always here to help! Reach out to us and we can have a chat!
    - Aim to complete every lab/homework assignment.
        - They are exercises in programmatic thinking.
        - However, completing an assignment and only sleeping for two hours is worse than sleeping and not completing an assignment.
        - Keep lines of communication open with your instructor team; they can help you prioritize your class assignments.
7. When should I ask questions?
    - Ask for help only when you've been stuck for 30 minutes or more.
        - The more time you spend fixing your own bugs, the more you will learn!
        - Getting an answer from someone else can stall the learning process.

### Our **Advice**

1. Ask for continuous feedback.
2. Stand up and walk around throughout the day.
3. Get out a little bit each day and do something that's not related to programming.
4. Do not compare yourself to others. This is about your journey!
